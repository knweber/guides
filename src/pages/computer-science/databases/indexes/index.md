## Indexes

At a high level, database indexes can be thought of like the index pages in the back of a textbook. If you're looking for a particular concept, rather than skimming the entire book, you can flip to the index and find which specific pages discuss that concept. Indexes in databases act in the same manner, allowing a user to more quickly find specific records using a reference to those records' "location" within the table.
